# 1. Haystacking

In this game, the player needs to move their avatar left and right to catch the haystack falling from the sky to meet the target within the time limit.

## Game Mechanics

There is an option for a single player mode and one for two player mode.

### Single Player Mode

Each player has three lives to begin with. They lose a life when hit by a shovel or a bucket, and gain an extra life when they collect a star.

The haystack is of different shape and the player needs to balance them well on the platform. The player will lose the current haystack if it topples. The player could empty their haystack to a collection bucket on the side, where the percentage of target achieved is shown.

The next two items to be falling from the sky is shown on the console.

As the player has more haystack on their platform, they will move slower.

### Double Player Mode

The two players can either collaborate to reach a common target, or play against each other.

When playing together, the game mechanics are similar to that of the single player mode except for now the stack will be falling at a faster speed and the next two stacks will not be shown.

In the competition mode, the game console will be divided into two, each half will have features from the single player mode. Whoever that reaches the target first will win the game.

# 2. Fireboy & Watergirl

## **Core Gameplay:**
Players control characters with different attributes, working together to solve puzzles and clear platform-based levels. The maps are filled with various terrain features, such as elevated platforms, moving platforms, mechanisms, and traps. Some obstacles require cooperation between different characters to pass through.

### **Innovative Features:**

#### 1. **Character Design: Elemental Interaction + Two-Player Control**
- **(1)** Player 1 controls their character using the WASD keys, while Player 2 uses the arrow keys.  
- **(2)** Players can interact with each other in specific scenarios:
  - **Carry:** One player can hold the other, preventing them from moving independently.  
  - **Compact Mode:** The held player shrinks in size, making it easier to pass through narrow spaces.  
  - **Throw:** One player can launch the other like a projectile to bypass obstacles.

- **(3)** Each character has a distinct elemental attribute—such as wind, water, fire, or electricity—each of which influences the environment:
  - **Wind:** Blows away obstacles or propels the player forward.  
  - **Water:** Fills low-lying areas, allowing players to swim across.  
  - **Fire:** Burns wooden obstacles.  
  - **Electricity:** Activates mechanisms or short-circuits devices to disable enemies.

- **(4)** Survival conditions vary between characters:
  - **Fire Attribute:** Can safely pass through fire pools but dies upon contact with water or poison pools.  
  - **Water Attribute:** Can safely pass through water pools but dies when encountering fire or poison pools.

### **Obstacle and Mechanism Design:**
- **(1) Lasers:** Touching the laser beams results in death. Players must find shields to block the beams.  
- **(2) Pushable Boxes:** Players can push boxes to specific locations to activate switches or fill gaps.  
- **(3) Pressure Switches:** Players stand on pressure plates to activate mechanisms, such as opening doors or moving platforms.  
- **(4) Pull Levers:** Approaching a lever triggers its effect, changing the map layout dynamically.  
- **(5) Moving Platforms:** Platforms move continuously, requiring players to time their jumps precisely.  
- **(6) Spikes:** Spikes can appear suddenly in unexpected places. Touching them results in death.

---

### **Achievement System:**
- **(1) Collecting Diamonds:** Players must collect a specified number of diamonds to complete the level. Hidden diamonds offer additional challenges, and the number collected affects the level rating.  
- **(2) Time Limits:** Each level has three tiers of completion times. The faster the players complete a level, the higher the rank they achieve.

---

### **Design Challenges:**
- **(1) Map Design:** Designing maps within a fixed screen size while ensuring seamless integration of obstacles and mechanisms. The map must also accommodate varying player jump heights.  
- **(2) Compatibility of Elemental Interactions and Mechanisms:** The game should allow players to complete levels regardless of the combination of characters chosen.  
- **(3) Physics Interaction and Collision Detection:** Accurate and responsive physical interactions between players, objects, and environmental elements are essential to ensure smooth gameplay.
