## Quantitative evaluation: System Usability Scale (SUS) Analysis

We collected and analyzed SUS questionnaire data from 12 users for both Level 1 and Level 2, calculating their total SUS scores. We then used the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in usability scores between the two levels.

### Survey Results
The following two tables are the data we obtained by finding 12 players to try out the game level 1 and level 2 without being informed. In order to ensure that they are not affected by the previous experience level, 6 of them experienced level 1 first and then level 2, and the other 6 experienced the opposite order.

### SUS Total Scores (Per User):
Based on each player's score for each question, we calculated each player's level 1 and level 2 scores according to the SUS score calculation rules and calculated the average score for each level. The results are shown in the following table:
<div align="center">

| User | Level 1 | Level 2 |
|------|---------|---------|
| U1   | 93.75   | 87.50   |
| U2   | 72.50   | 67.50   |
| U3   | 92.50   | 90.00   |
| U4   | 85.00   | 85.00   |
| U5   | 90.00   | 95.00   |
| U6   | 60.00   | 62.50   |
| U7   | 72.50   | 77.50   |
| U8   | 82.50   | 80.00   |
| U9   | 57.50   | 57.50   |
| U10  | 52.50   | 52.50   |
| U11  | 92.50   | 90.00   |
| U12  | 92.50   | 92.50   |
| **Average** | **78.13** | **77.92** |

##### Based on the above data, we draw the bar chart of each player's score and the average score bar chart of the two level games, as shown below:

### Results Analysis:
For SUS scoring, we used the standard SUS calculation method: each user rated 10 questions on a scale from 1 to 5. For the odd-numbered questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), the score is calculated as “rating minus 1,” and for the even-numbered questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), the score is “5 minus the rating.” The total of these adjusted scores is then multiplied by 2.5 to obtain the user's SUS score (ranging from 0 to 100). We calculated the SUS scores for each user for both Level 1 and Level 2 and computed the average. The results showed that the average usability score for Level 1 was 78.85, while for Level 2 it was 71.88. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was performed to determine whether the difference between the two levels was statistically significant, and the result (p = 0.518) indicated that there was no significant difference in usability between Level 1 and Level 2.

Although the score for Level 2 was slightly lower, this suggests that users may have found the increased difficulty to slightly impact usability; however, the overall usability remained high for both levels. This implies that the game interface and interactions were consistent and intuitive across different difficulty settings, even as gameplay complexity increased.
