# Game Inspiration

## Car Park Puzzle

The game console is a 2D overview of a car park. Player needs to drive their car out through the car park exit by moving the surrounding cars. Cars can only be moved forward or backward, without the possibiliy of making turns.

### Possible Twists

- Adjust the number of surrounding cars based on difficulty levels.
- Arrange cars in a way that they face different directions.
- Change the car park to a bus station. There are passengers waiting in a queue for different buses. Passengers need to get on the bus of the same colour as them. The game is won when all passengers are able to get on to the bus.
- Add other features of a real car park, e.g. pedestrian crossings, unloading areas for lorries. 


## Fireboy & Watergirl

### Game Type
Fireboy and Watergirl is a cooperative puzzle-platform game.

### Game Overview
This game requires two players to control characters with distinct attributes—Fireboy and Watergirl—working together to complete various levels. Fireboy is controlled using the arrow keys, while Watergirl is controlled using the WASD keys. Fireboy can safely pass through fire, while Watergirl can safely pass through water. However, if Fireboy or Watergirl touch the opposite element, they die, and the level must be restarted. Additionally, green acid is deadly to both characters. Players can collect diamonds in each level, and upon completion, a chart displays their rating based on the number of diamonds collected.

### Game Mechanisms

- **Fireboy:**
  - Controlled with the arrow keys, Fireboy has fire attributes. He can safely pass through fire pools but will die upon touching water pools or green acid.
