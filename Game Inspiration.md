# Game Inspiration

## Car Park Puzzle

The game console is a 2D overview of a car park. Player needs to drive their car out through the car park exit by moving the surrounding cars. Cars can only be moved forward or backward, without the possibiliy of making turns.

### Possible Twists

- Adjust the number of surrounding cars based on difficulty levels.
- Arrange cars in a way that they face different directions.
- Change the car park to a bus station. There are passengers waiting in a queue for different buses. Passengers need to get on the bus of the same colour as them. The game is won when all passengers are able to get on to the bus.
- Add other features of a real car park, e.g. pedestrian crossings, unloading areas for lorries. 

## Flappy Bird

In this game, the player only needs to press the spacebar (or click the mouse, or touch the screen) to make the bird fly higher. When the spacebar is released, the bird will start to fall. The goal is to keep the bird flying for as long as possible.

### Possible Twists

- Randomly place obstacles along the way. If the bird hits any of them, the game is over.
- Track score increment. Each time the bird successfully passes through an obstacle, the score increases by one.
- Add some bonuses along the way. If the bird collects them, different effects can occur, such as increased speed, additional score, or a temporary ability to prevent falling.
- Increase the game's difficulty over time by increasing the speed, reducing the gap between obstacles, or adding moving obstacles.
- Introduce multiple game modes, including multiplayer mode, time-limited mode, or other special modes.
