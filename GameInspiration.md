## Car Park Puzzle

The game console is a 2D overview of a car park. The player needs to drive their car out through the car park exit by moving the surrounding cars. Cars can only be moved forward or backward, without the possibiliy of making turns.

### Possible Twists

- Adjust the number of surrounding cars based on difficulty levels.
- Arrange cars in a way that they face different directions.
- Change the car park to a bus station. There are passengers waiting in a queue for different buses. Passengers need to get on the bus of the same colour as them. The game is won when all passengers are able to get on to the bus.
- Add other features of a real car park, e.g. pedestrian crossings, unloading areas for lorries.
