## Basic Gameplay

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Size Settings (Character, Basket, Grass)** | **Basket**: xx, **Board**: 120Ã—20, **Grass**: xx |
| **Speed Settings (Character Movement, Grass Falling)** | Grass only falls in the right area of the basket, falling speed = xx |
|  | Character can only move **left and right** on the same horizontal line (y = xx), movement speed = xx |
|  | Each time the character catches a grass pile, movement speed **decreases by xx** |
| **Collision Detection (When Grass is Considered Caught)** | If the board has **no grass**, when the **bottom of a falling grass pile** touches any part of the board, it stays still, indicating it is caught |
|  | If the board **already has grass** (less than 5), when the **bottom of a falling grass pile** touches the top of the highest grass pile, it stays still |
| **Death Conditions** | Initial lives: **3** |
|  | If a **grass pile is missed**, lives -1 |
|  | If lives reach **0**, the game ends |
|  | When the player loses a life: The **character and board flash for 1.5s**, falling grass stops, everything except the character and board **freezes**, and the **first red heart from the right turns gray** |
|  | After losing all lives, the game transitions to the **Game Over** screen |
| **Scoring Rules** | If the player moves near the **basket** (e.g., the left edge of the board touches the right edge of the basket), pressing **spacebar** drops the collected grass piles |
|  | The **score** is equal to the **number of grass piles** on the board |
|  | Each level has a **time limit**; reaching the **target score within the time** advances to the next level |
|  | Scores are **cumulative** across levels |

## Advanced Gameplay

### **Level Design**

|-------|---------|
| **Level 1** | Only square grass piles, fixed fall speed = xx, time limit = xx |
| **Level 2** | Only square grass piles, fall speed increases by xx every xx seconds, time limit = xx |
| **Level 3** | Square grass piles + buckets, fixed fall speed = xx, time limit = xx |
| **Level 4** | Square grass piles + buckets, fall speed increases by xx every xx seconds, time limit = xx |
| **Level 5** | Square grass piles + buckets + hearts, fixed fall speed = xx, time limit = xx |
| **Level 6** | Square grass piles + buckets + hearts, fall speed increases by xx every xx seconds, time limit = xx |

### **Special Items**
| Item | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **Bucket** | If hit, **-1 life** and all collected grass on the board is lost |
| **Heart** | Does **not count as a grass pile**, can be caught even if the board already holds 5 piles; grants **+1 life** |
| **Timer** | Adds **+10s** to the remaining time |
| **Slowdown Obstacle** | Reduces movement speed to **x0.8** |
