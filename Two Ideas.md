# 1. Grass Catching

In this game, the player needs to move their avatar left and right to catch the haystack falling from the sky to meet the target within the time limit.

## Game Mechanics

There is an option for a single player mode and one for two player mode.

### Single Player Mode

- Each player has three lives to begin with. They lose a life when hit by a shovel or a bucket, and gain an extra life when they collect a star.
- The haystack is of different shape and the player needs to balance them well on the platform. The player will lose the current haystack if it topples. The player could empty their haystack to a collection bucket on the side, where the percentage of target achieved is shown.
- The next two items to be falling from the sky is shown on the console.
- As the player has more haystack on their platform, they will move slower.

### Double Player Mode

The two players can either collaborate to reach a common target, or play against each other.

When playing together, the game mechanics are similar to that of the single player mode except for now the stack will be falling at a faster speed and the next two stacks will not be shown.

In the competition mode, the game console will be divided into two, each half will have features from the single player mode. Whoever that reaches the target first will win the game.
