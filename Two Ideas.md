## 1. Grass Catching

In this game, the player needs to move their avatar left and right to catch all the haystack falling from the sky.

### Game Mechanics
Initial Speed: At the start of the game, the character moves quickly, allowing easy maneuvering to catch grass.

Weight Accumulation: As the player catches more grass, the character's movement speed gradually decreases. This simulates the effect of carrying a heavier load.
- The more grass collected, the slower the character moves.
- Slower movement increases the difficulty of positioning to catch falling grass accurately.

Dynamic Balance: By gradually increasing the difficulty, this mechanic forces players to make more strategic and precise decisions in the later stages.

### Effects of the Mechanic
Impact on Player Actions
- Players need to anticipate where the grass will fall and adjust their position in advance since slower movement makes catching grass more challenging.
- Quick reaction times and efficient planning become more critical as the game progresses.
Impact on Game Pacing
- The early stages of the game are fast-paced and allow for more freedom of movement.
- As the grass accumulates, the game becomes more tense and strategic, requiring players to adapt to the slower pace.
