# 3.Introduction
- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

Our game is a casual stacking challenge inspired by a classic mini-game from the popular title *Mole Manor*. Drawing from its gameplay, we set the game's backdrop during the harvest season on a farm. Players must control their character's left and right movements to catch falling haystacks and place them into a basket within a limited time in order to reach the collection goal and advance to the next level.

To increase the game's difficulty and reflect real-world limitations on how much a person can carry, each player can catch a maximum of five haystacks at a time. If this limit is exceeded, the character will stumble and drop all collected hay. This mechanic not only adds tension but also introduces strategic decision-makingâ€”players must carefully balance between collecting more hay and emptying their basket in time.

As hay accumulates, the character's movement speed gradually slows down, requiring players to choose the right moment to clear their collection bucket and maintain agility. Building on the original gameplay, the game introduces more challenging elements: in single-player mode, players must dodge falling shovels and buckets while collecting stars for extra lives. In two-player mode, players can either collaborate to achieve a shared goal or compete to see who finishes first. These design features enrich the gameplay and deliver a fun, fast-paced, yet relaxing farm harvest experience.

The following table shows the main elements of the game:

## 4.2 Game Delection Process

As part of our game development planning, our team initially brainstormed and analyzed five different game inspirations. After careful discussion and evaluation, we shortlisted two candidates for prototyping:Fireboy & Watergirl and Grass Catching.

To better understand and experience the game mechanics, we created paper prototypes for both games. By interacting with the prototypes directly, we were able to simulate the core gameplay and interaction flow, design basic maps and character movement paths, observe players' intuitive understanding and reactions, and evaluate whether the gameplay was engaging and expandable.

The following are our paper prototypes for Fireboy & Watergirl and Grass Catching.

</p>

## 4.3 Final Decision
After multiple rounds of testing and team feedback, we ultimately selected Grass Catching as the core game for our project. This decision was based on several key factors: the gameplay mechanics are simple yet offer meaningful challenge, making the game easy to implement while allowing for depth through the addition of items, constraints, and variations.

It also features high replayabilityâ€”players slow down as they collect more grass, creating a naturally increasing difficulty curve well-suited for score-based challenges. Furthermore, the concept has great potential for creative expansion, such as adding multiplayer modes, weather effects, special types of grass, and animated visual effects. Finally, its intuitive gameplay makes it highly accessible and easy to promote, appealing to a wide range of players and suitable for release on web or mobile platforms.

## 4.4 Digital Paper Prototype tool

To help players quickly get familiar with the game, we created a digital model based on the paper prototype. Hanying attempted to generate the digital model using her iPad, which allowed for a representation that more closely resembled the actual game compared to the paper prototype.

This animation shows the player successfully catching the grass and placing it into the barrel.

## 4.5 Requirement Analysis

### 4.5.1 User Requirements
- Players should be able to control and stack square grass blocks smoothly

### 4.5.2 Technical Requirements
- Client-side Development: Implement the game interface and handle user input
- Physics Simulation: Remove the external physics engine and use a simple square block stacking mechanism

### 4.5.3 Technical Feasibility Study

#### Initial Plan
- Use an external physics engine (e.g., Box2D, Matter.js) for simulating different shape interactions
- Requires complex physics calculations, including collision detection and gravity simulation

#### Feasibility Evaluation
- Lack of experience in physics engine development makes debugging and optimization challenging
- Complex physics calculations may lead to high computational resource consumption, affecting game performance

#### Alternative Plan
- Switch to simple square grass block stacking without relying on an external physics engine
- Use a rule-based stacking method where each block is placed according to predefined logic
- Implement basic rectangle overlap detection for collision handling to improve development efficiency

Based on the feasibility analysis, we have decided to adjust the game design by abandoning the complex physics engine integration and opting for a simple square grass block stacking mechanism. This will reduce technical difficulty, improve development efficiency, and ensure game stability.

## 4.6 Stakeholders Analysis 

Following the establishment of the initial idea for our game, conducting a stakeholder analysis is a critical step. By identifying key parties such as developers, players, and other developer teams, and clarifying their roles and needs, our team can more effectively allocate resources, enhance both the technical feasibility and the overall user experience of the game.

</p>

### Core Layer: Group 30
Group 30-2025 are the core developer of the game, responsible for its design, development, and implementation. They determine the quality, gameplay, and overall experience of the game.

### Internal Layer: Players and Lecturers
- **Players**: The end-users of the game, including:
  - New Players
  - Old Players
  - Casual Players
  - Competitive Players
- **Lecturers**: The evaluators of the assignment, responsible for assessing the quality of the game and whether it meets course requirements

### Competition Layer: Other Teams
Other teams are competitors in the assignment, and their performance may influence the evaluation by lecturers and bystanders.

### External Layer: Broader Audience
Bystanders are potential users who may not directly participate in the game but could be attracted to become new players.

### Feasibility Study
Based on the stakeholder analysis, we proceeded to evaluate the feasibility of the project.
The feasibility study primarily focused on the technical aspects, including the development environment, available tools, and team skills.

#### Initial Plan
Initially, we considered implementing stacking mechanics using various shapes as the core gameplay feature. This approach would require:

- Integration of an external physics engine (e.g., Box2D, Matter.js) to simulate realistic physical interactions

- Implementation of complex physics logic such as collision detection and gravity effects

#### Feasibility Evaluation
However, after evaluating the technical feasibility, we identified several challenges:

- Our team lacks experience in integrating and configuring physics engines 

- Limited familiarity with real-time physics would significantly increase the debugging and optimization workload

- A poorly implemented physics system would negatively impact gameplay quality and user experience

#### Alternative Plan
In this case, we decided to simplify the design by:

- Switching to simple square grass block stacking without relying on an external physics engine
- Using a rule-based stacking method where each block is placed according to predefined logic
- Implementing basic rectangle overlap detection for collision handling to improve development efficiency

Originally, one of the key technical challenges was determining how to position irregularly shaped grass blocks in a physically accurate and visually satisfying way.
With the new simplified plan, the focus shifts to how to perfectly and completely align square grass blocks on top of one another, which significantly reduces complexity while preserving core gameplay value.

## 4.7 User Stories and Epics

Based on the stakeholder analysis and requirements analysis above, we identified the core needs of different user groups and created corresponding user stories. These user stories not only reflect the basic functional requirements of the game but also provide a foundation for subsequent sustainability design. During the development process, we further integrated these user stories with sustainability dimensions, particularly expanding on the social and technical aspects.

In the early stages, we created initial user stories based on the behavior patterns and expectations of different user types (such as casual players, hardcore players, social players, etc.) to ensure that the core gameplay of HayStacking would meet the diverse needs of its target users. In the later development phase, we refined and expanded these user stories by incorporating a sustainability perspective, primarily drawing from the five dimensions defined in the SusAF framework: Individual, Social, Environmental, Economic, and Technical. This allowed us to evaluate the potential impacts of the game from a more holistic standpoint. The following table presents the finalized user stories along with their corresponding acceptance criteria.

# 6.Implementation

- 15% ~750 words
- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game. 

## 6.1 Challenges
### 6.1.1 challenge 1:
A key gameplay mechanic in Haystacking involves dropping haystacks and other items (e.g., shovels, speed boot) at regular intervals. To implement this, we initially used `setInterval()` function to call object drop every few seconds.

However, we ran into a timing issue when implementing pause and resume functionality. If the player paused and resumed the game multiple times, objects would begin dropping too frequently â€” sometimes multiple items would fall at once. After debugging, we realized that every time the game was resumed, a new interval was being created without clearing the previous one, leading to multiple concurrent timers calling object drop.

To solve this, we updated the code to ensure that only one interval exists at any time. We used `clearInterval()` and set the reference to null before starting a new interval, which added a guard to prevent multiple intervals from stacking. This change allowed us to reliably manage the start and stop behavior of the object drops. It also made the codebase more maintainable and predictable when adding new features related to item timing or difficulty scaling.

### 6.1.2 challenge 2: Game Balance Adjustment and Player Experience Optimization

During the game development process, through continuous testing and player feedback, we identified and gradually resolved balance issues that were affecting the overall gameplay experience.

In the initial version, we implemented a **health system** with the intention of increasing the game's difficulty. However, during actual testing, we discovered that this design made players **overly cautious**â€”especially after collecting a significant number of grass blocks. Players became more focused on avoiding mistakes for fear of losing health, which not only limited their strategic choices but also increased the likelihood of failure due to the added **psychological pressure**.

After discussions within the team, we decided to **remove the health system**. This change **freed players from the stress** of managing health, allowing them to experiment more freely with different actions and strategies.

As development progressed, we encountered another balancing issue in the game mechanics. Our design required players to **achieve a certain score within a set time** to pass a level. To meet this goal, players were naturally inclined to **catch as many grass bundles as possible** in one go. 

However, we had also implemented a **weight system**: the more grass a player collected, the slower they would move. These two systems conflicted in practiceâ€”while players wanted to gather more grass to score higher, the resulting **decrease in movement speed** made it difficult to quickly reach the right position to catch grass accurately.

After multiple rounds of adjustment and testing, we finally found a **balance**: we **fine-tuned the rate** at which the player's movement speed decreased with the amount of grass collected. This preserved the **strategic aspect** of the weight system without overly hindering the gameplay experience.

Through this series of adjustments and optimizations, we successfully achieved our intended gameplay experience:

- **New players** can quickly get started and feel a **sense of accomplishment**.  
- **Experienced players** can pursue **high scores** through perfect execution.  
- The **difficulty curve** has become smoother.  
- **Player retention** has significantly improved.

# 7.Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words
- One qualitative evaluation (your choice) 
- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice) 
- Description of how code was tested. 

To ensure a balance between functionality and usability during the game development process, we chose to combine both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Qualitative analysis helped us identify issues within the game, while quantitative evaluation provided insights into user perceptions, guiding us to iteratively improve the design.
## 7.1 Qualitative Evaluation - Heuristic Evaluation
 For the qualitative method, we adopted Heuristic Evaluation, a practical and widely used approach that examines the interface based on Nielsen's ten usability principles. By systematically reviewing each screen of our game, we identified several usability issues, including unclear navigation flow, inconsistent system feedback, limited user control, and lack of clarity in competitive scoring. Each issue was evaluated across three dimensionsâ€”Frequency, Impact, and Persistenceâ€”to calculate a severity score and prioritize the most critical problems.The results are shown in the following table:

</table>

Based on the severity scores in the evaluation table, we will prioritize addressing high-severity issues, such as speed inconsistency across platforms and insufficient time display in multiplayer mode.    next development focus will be on enhancing the user experience by improving UI feedback, adding return and help buttons, and introducing a store system for character/tool customization. Through these improvements, we aim to create a smoother, more intuitive, and more engaging gameplay experience.

## 7.2 Quantitative Evaluation - SUS evaluation
We collected and analyzed SUS questionnaire data from 12 users for both Level 1 and Level 2, calculating their total SUS scores. We then used the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in usability scores between the two levels. Click [here](sus.md) to see the raw data.

</div>
The results of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for the System Usability Scale (SUS) scores show no statistically significant difference between the two difficulty levels (W = 10.5, p = 0.5461). Although individual user scores vary slightly, both the easy and hard levels received generally high SUS scores. This suggests that users found the game to be consistently usable across both difficulty settings.

## 7.3 Test
We mainly conducted black-box testing for the game. The test cases were designed based on the equivalence partitioning method and focused on core game functionalities. Testing covered five major areas: game mode selection, player movement control, grass block collection mechanics, score calculation system, and shovel item system.
Each test case was designed following the equivalence class principle, covering valid inputs, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions.
The test results showed that all core functionalities are working correctly, including interface responsiveness, player control accuracy, game mechanic stability, score calculation correctness, and item system functionality.
Special attention was given to boundary condition handling, such as screen edge limits, basket capacity limits, and time limits, ensuring the game operates normally under all conditions.
All test cases passed, indicating that the core functions have been successfully implemented and are operating correctly.

# 8.Sustainability

## 8.1 Introducing Green Software Design Principles

In today's digital era where environmental awareness and technological advancement go hand in hand, software is not only expected to deliver functionality, but also to operate sustainably. As high-frequency and long-session digital media, games involve complex graphics rendering, logical processing, and user-driven interactionsâ€”all of which contribute to device energy consumption and environmental impact.

To align with green software development, we referenced the Green Software Patterns proposed by the Green Software Foundation. These patterns guide the development process from multiple anglesâ€”such as performance, resource efficiency, user behavior, and architectural structureâ€”to achieve sustainable and energy-efficient game design.

## 8.2 Identifying Green Logic Chains from Real-World Issues

During the early discussion phase of our project, we analyzed key sustainability challenges based on the operational characteristics of our game. These challenges span multiple dimensions:

Excessive graphics rendering causes overheating and power drain.

Multiplayer experiences require multiple devices, resulting in low hardware utilization.

Repetitive asset design leads to resource waste and maintenance overhead.

Lack of modular structure increases redundant code and reduces energy efficiency.

Building upon these identified issues, we abstracted green logic chains based on green design principles and integrated them into our game development workflow.

## 8.3 Green Logic Chains and Deductive Paths

- UI and Visual Design

Keywords: Graphics load, rendering efficiency, minimal visual complexityProblem Source: Complex visuals and frequent animations overload the GPU/CPUDeduction Logic: Reduce visual complexity â†’ Lower image processing â†’ Save energyImplementation:
Use pixel-style, low-resolution assets
Keep sessions short and load only necessary assets using lazy loading
Avoid complex animations and optimize render rate

- Asset Reuse

Keywords: Repetitive content, resource redundancy, storage overheadProblem Source: Designing new assets for each level leads to wasteDeduction Logic: Modularize assets â†’ Enable reuse â†’ Reduce development and loading costImplementation:
Reuse grass, barrels, and character sprites across levels
Manage assets uniformly to reduce redundant storage and image loading cost

- Shared Optimization

Keywords: Device burden, social interaction, shared hardwareProblem Source: Multiplayer play demands multiple devicesDeduction Logic: Support same-device multiplayer â†’ Improve utilization â†’ Reduce hardware energy useImplementation:
Enable two-player collaboration and turn-based modes
Encourage all gameplay to occur on a single shared device

- Code Optimization

Keywords: Structural redundancy, execution efficiency, maintainabilityProblem Source: Mixed logic and redundant structures lead to low system efficiencyDeduction Logic: Modular structure â†’ Reduce repetition â†’ Improve performance and lower energy useImplementation:
Clearly divided functions like dropGrass() and checkCatch()
Decoupled structure to avoid unnecessary refreshes or duplicate checks

## 8.4 Visualization of Sustainability Impact Pathways

To better visualize the sustainability logic in Hay-stacking, we mapped our design decisions to the five dimensions of the SusAF modelâ€”Individual, Social, Technical, Environmental, and Economicâ€”following the Immediate â†’ Enabling â†’ Structural logic. Each design pattern contributes not only to immediate efficiency, but also to long-term structural sustainability.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 10: Sustainability Awareness Diagram</b></p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcf6ef86-3c7f-488f-917f-530946ea2709" width="600">
</p>


As shown in the figure:

In the technical dimension, resource redundancy is reduced through asset compression, streamlined logic structures, and modular code.

In the environmental dimension, low-resolution graphics and lazy loading effectively lower rendering energy consumption.

In the economic dimension, asset reuse and shared device usage reduce development and maintenance costs.

In the social dimension, cooperative mechanics and fair-play systems enhance user interaction and resource sharing.

In the individual dimension, short session design and low-pressure gameplay help players establish healthy usage patterns.

## 8.5 Sustainability Implementation via SusAF Dimensions

Throughout the design and development of this game, we adopted several green software engineering strategies focused on three core goals: reducing resource consumption, increasing device utilization, and minimizing environmental impact. These approaches align with the five dimensions of the Sustainability Awareness Framework (SusAF)â€”environmental, technical, economic, individual, and socialâ€”and incorporate best practices from the Green Software Foundation Patterns.

- Energy-efficient UI and system design (Environmental + Technical)

The game features a minimalist pixel-art style and low-resolution assets, significantly reducing GPU rendering demands. By simplifying animations and offering short-session gameplay with lazy-loading techniques, we limit CPU and memory usage during runtime. These decisions contribute to lower energy consumption and extended device lifespan, aligning with the Demand Shaping and Green Hosting patterns.

- Shared device and multiplayer optimization (Social + Economic)

We support local two-player modesâ€”either co-op or alternating turnsâ€”allowing multiple users to share a single device. This reduces the need for additional hardware purchases and enhances the usage rate of existing devices, thereby decreasing e-waste. The approach reflects the Substitution and Behaviour Change principles in promoting sustainable patterns of production and consumption.

- Reusable assets across levels (Technical + Environmental)

Common assetsâ€”such as grass blocks, barrels, and character modelsâ€”are reused across multiple levels, avoiding redundant design work and reducing digital resource overhead. This follows the Material Optimization pattern, lowering both development and storage costs, and reducing the carbon footprint associated with asset creation and management.

- Modular and clean code structure (Technical + Economic)

The game logic is divided into clear, maintainable modules with optimized, lightweight code. This ensures efficient resource use, improves responsiveness, and simplifies long-term maintenance and scalability. These practices reflect the principles of Sustainable Software Architecture, contributing to both system efficiency and development cost reduction.

Through these sustainability practices, our game actively addresses the environmental and technical challenges of software engineering. These efforts not only reduce the environmental burden of the product but also enhance the overall efficiency, maintainability, and user experience of the system.

## 8.6 Conclusion

By following a structured path of problem identification â†’ pattern matching â†’ logic deduction â†’ implementation, our development of Hay-stacking embedded green design at every level. This not only improved system performance but also reduced environmental impact and promoted sustainable awareness among players. The approach provides a reproducible model for future green game design and sustainable software engineering.
