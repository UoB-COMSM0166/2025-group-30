## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

Our **Haystacking** game is an innovative stacking-based casual challenge inspired by the classic game **Grass Catching**. 
Set during the harvest season on a farm, players must control their characterâ€™s movement left and right to catch falling 
haystacks and collect as much hay as possible within a limited time to reach the goal.

#### **Game Objective**
The game challenges playersâ€™ balancing and strategic skills while simulating the intensity of farm harvesting. 
Players must constantly adjust their position and respond flexibly to randomly falling hay. If too much hay 
accumulates, movement speed will slow down, making it harder to catch additional falling hay. Therefore, 
players need to empty the collection bucket at the right time to maintain stability.

#### **Game Mechanics**
Building upon **Grass Catching**, **Haystacking** introduces increased difficulty and strategic depth. In 
single-player mode, players must avoid falling shovels and buckets while collecting stars to gain extra lives. 
In two-player mode, players can either cooperate to reach a shared goal or compete to be the first to achieve 
the target. As haystack accumulation increases, movement speed gradually slows down, making the later stages 
of the game more challenging and strategic.

#### **Game Significance**
The game tests playersâ€™ reflexes, spatial awareness, and strategic planning skills while creating a relaxed 
yet challenging farm-harvesting atmosphere. With simple and intuitive controls, **Haystacking** offers both excitement and tension. Whether playing solo or competing with friends, this game delivers a uniquely entertaining experience!

### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop? 

#### Inspiration

In the first week of our game project, we held a team meeting to discuss various game ideas based on our understanding of different game concepts. We evaluated each idea based on familiarity, innovation, and feasibility, ultimately brainstorming five potential game concepts. After thorough discussion, we conducted a vote, and the Grass Catching Game emerged as the final winner.

The inspiration for our grass-catching game comes from Mole's World. Unlike the grass-catching mechanics in Mole's World, where the grass follows a parabolic trajectory, our game adopts a vertical free-fall motion, emphasizing players' reaction speed and precise judgment. Additionally, the grass may have different falling speeds and shapes, allowing for difficulty adjustments that present players with more challenging grass-catching tasks.

#### Prototype

During the conceptualization of the grass-catching game, we created a paper prototype to help visualize and test early game mechanics, including the way the grass falls, as well as the player's movement and interactions. Based on our initial discussions, we refined the game flow and mechanics, adding new elements to enhance the game's fun and challenge. To provide players with a clearer understanding of the game, we created a video based on the paper prototype, offering an intuitive demonstration of the gameplay.

#### Digita Paper Prototype tool

To help players quickly get familiar with the game, we created a digital model based on the paper prototype. Hanying attempted to generate the digital model using her iPad, which allowed for a representation that more closely resembled the actual game compared to the paper prototype.
