## Project Report

### Introduction


Our game is a casual stacking challenge inspired by a classic mini-game from the popular title *Mole Manor*. Drawing from its gameplay, we set the gameâ€™s backdrop during the harvest season on a farm. Players must control their characterâ€™s left and right movements to catch falling haystacks and place them into a basket within a limited time in order to reach the collection goal and advance to the next level.

To increase the gameâ€™s difficulty and reflect real-world limitations on how much a person can carry, each player can catch a maximum of five haystacks at a time. If this limit is exceeded, the character will stumble and drop all collected hay. This mechanic not only adds tension but also introduces strategic decision-makingâ€”players must carefully balance between collecting more hay and emptying their basket in time.

As hay accumulates, the characterâ€™s movement speed gradually slows down, requiring players to choose the right moment to clear their collection bucket and maintain agility. Building on the original gameplay, the game introduces more challenging elements: in single-player mode, players must dodge falling shovels and buckets while collecting stars for extra lives. In two-player mode, players can either collaborate to achieve a shared goal or compete to see who finishes first. These design features enrich the gameplay and deliver a fun, fast-paced, yet relaxing farm harvest experience.

The following table shows the main elements of the game:

#### Inspiration

In the first week of our game project, we held a team meeting to discuss various game ideas based on our understanding of different game concepts. We evaluated each idea based on familiarity, innovation, and feasibility, ultimately brainstorming five potential game concepts. After thorough discussion, we conducted a vote, and the Grass Catching Game emerged as the final winner.

The inspiration for our grass-catching game comes from Mole's World. Unlike the grass-catching mechanics in Mole's World, where the grass follows a parabolic trajectory, our game adopts a vertical free-fall motion, emphasizing players' reaction speed and precise judgment. Additionally, the grass may have different falling speeds and shapes, allowing for difficulty adjustments that present players with more challenging grass-catching tasks.

#### Prototype

During the conceptualization of the grass-catching game, we created a paper prototype to help visualize and test early game mechanics, including the way the grass falls, as well as the player's movement and interactions. Based on our initial discussions, we refined the game flow and mechanics, adding new elements to enhance the game's fun and challenge. To provide players with a clearer understanding of the game, we created a video based on the paper prototype, offering an intuitive demonstration of the gameplay.

#### Digital Paper Prototype tool

To help players quickly get familiar with the game, we created a digital model based on the paper prototype. Hanying attempted to generate the digital model using her iPad, which allowed for a representation that more closely resembled the actual game compared to the paper prototype.

**Project overview**

The project aims to develop a simple 2D mini-game where players stack square grass blocks.
Initially, we considered using different shapes for stacking as the core gameplay mechanism and planned to integrate an external physics engine for realistic physics simulation. 
However, after preliminary research and technical assessment, we found that our current skill level poses certain limitations in implementing this approach. Therefore, we reassessed the feasibility.
Eventually, we decided to remove the physics engine and use a simple square grass block stacking mechanism to reduce technical complexity.

**Requirement Analysis**

#### 1. User Requirements
- Players should be able to control and stack square grass blocks smoothly

#### 2. Technical Requirements
- Client-side Development: Implement the game interface and handle user input
- Physics Simulation: Remove the external physics engine and use a simple square block stacking mechanism

#### Technical Feasibility Study

##### Initial Plan
- Use an external physics engine (e.g., Box2D, Matter.js) for simulating different shape interactions
- Requires complex physics calculations, including collision detection and gravity simulation

##### Feasibility Evaluation
- Lack of experience in physics engine development makes debugging and optimization challenging
- Complex physics calculations may lead to high computational resource consumption, affecting game performance

##### Alternative Plan
- Switch to simple square grass block stacking without relying on an external physics engine
- Use a rule-based stacking method where each block is placed according to predefined logic
- Implement basic rectangle overlap detection for collision handling to improve development efficiency

Based on the feasibility analysis, we have decided to adjust the game design by abandoning the complex physics engine integration and opting for a simple square grass block stacking mechanism. This will reduce technical difficulty, improve development efficiency, and ensure game stability.

### Evaluation
To ensure a balance between functionality and usability during the game development process, we chose to combine both qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods. Qualitative analysis helped us identify issues within the game, while quantitative evaluation provided insights into user perceptions, guiding us to iteratively improve the design.
#### Qualitative Evaluation - Heuristic Evaluation
 For the qualitative method, we adopted Heuristic Evaluation, a practical and widely used approach that examines the interface based on Nielsenâ€™s ten usability principles. By systematically reviewing each screen of our game, we identified several usability issues, including unclear navigation flow, inconsistent system feedback, limited user control, and lack of clarity in competitive scoring. Each issue was evaluated across three dimensionsâ€”Frequency, Impact, and Persistenceâ€”to calculate a severity score and prioritize the most critical problems.The results are shown in the following table:

  </tr>
</table>

Based on the severity scores in the evaluation table, we will prioritize addressing high-severity issues, such as speed inconsistency across platforms and insufficient time display in multiplayer mode.    next development focus will be on enhancing the user experience by improving UI feedback, adding return and help buttons, and introducing a store system for character/tool customization. Through these improvements, we aim to create a smoother, more intuitive, and more engaging gameplay experience.

#### SUS evaluation
We collected and analyzed SUS questionnaire data from 12 users for both Level 1 and Level 2, calculating their total SUS scores. We then used the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in usability scores between the two levels. Click [here](sus.md) to see the raw data.

<div align="center">
  <img src="averageScore.png" width="533">
</div>
The results of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for the System Usability Scale (SUS) scores show no statistically significant difference between the two difficulty levels (W = 10.5, p = 0.5461). Although individual user scores vary slightly, both the easy and hard levels received generally high SUS scores. This suggests that users found the game to be consistently usable across both difficulty settings.
